# mclscene

mclscene is a generic scene loader for some of my test projects. It parses an XML file
and stores metadata, which can then be extracted by another application for whatever purpose.
Included are distributions of: trimesh2 (Szymon Rusinkiewicz, gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/trimesh2),
tetgen (Hang Si, wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen), and pugixml (Arseny Kapoulkine, pugixml.org).
Currently it only handles triangle/tetrahedral meshes.

There is a viewer sample which can render the scene, but requires OpenGL and SFML 2.

# linking

The best way to include mclscene in your project is to add it as a submodule with git,
use cmake to call add_subdirectory, then use the ${MCLSCENE_LIBRARIES} and
${MCLSCENE_INCLUDE_DIRS} that are set during the build. I will improve this in the future

# todo

- Cleanup headers
- Support for texture wrapping
- Remove storage of components (takes too much space on big scenes)
- Mesh instancing
- Better viewer with shaders
- Export to other renderers (e.g., mitsuba)
